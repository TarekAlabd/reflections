When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to make my project in public and a lot of people can use it (open source).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because I can update my repository on github and need to update it on my local repository or I can make changes in my local and remote,
so my changes in two places are the same.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: when we need to use our copy of the code on github but without cahnging anything in the original code.
clones: when we need to copy a code from github to our local repository or from a place in our local repository to another place.
branches: when we need to add new features to the program and that happens in one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
if anyone of the collaborators edits something I can merge it with my local one.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
that's will be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when there're more than coders that work on one project.
we can review the changes before verifying.
