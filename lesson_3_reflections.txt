When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to make my project in public and a lot of people can use it (open source).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because I can update my repository on github and need to update it on my local repository or I can make changes in my local and remote,
so my changes in two places are the same.
