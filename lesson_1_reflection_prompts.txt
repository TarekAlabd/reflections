How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    
that was helpful because I can't notice that small bug because there're a lot of lines of codes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    
that makes us have all versions and if we want to reset the file before any changes, we can do that.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
pros: more precisely, writing specific descriptions, programming editor, editing online and auto save.
cons: take much time and do the same with all projects.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Because these files might be realted to each other like HTML and CSS files which make a webpage.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
git log: we get all commits that we did and that helps us know what has changes.
git diff: It can compare different versions of a file within git using their Ids.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

    
That's because we can know where is the bug from the history and try to solve it.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
we should try to upload some files
